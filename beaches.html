                      <h3>Italy</h3>
                      <p>Italy has 4,723 miles of coastline, dotted with some of the most beautiful beaches and seaside towns in the entire world. Think white sand, limestone cliffs, and the bluest, clearest waters imaginable. ... From Sicily to Sardinia, and everywhere in between.</p>

                      <h3>France</h3>
                      <p>France has plenty of coastline and beaches of different sorts to satisfy the millions of tourists and holidaymakers who flock to them each summer. But for the foreign visitor, a holiday on the French coast can sometimes be a disappointment if the resort or region chosen has the wrong kind of seaside or seashore.</p>

                      <h3>Germany</h3>
                      <p>Germany's northernmost island is fondly known as the 'Queen of the North Sea'. While lovers of Lindisfarne or Heligoland may disagree, Sylt can claim the crown thanks to its beaches. There are nearly 40km of fine sandy beaches along its west coast, so you should be able to find a spot for yourself.</p>

                      <h3>Spain</h3>
                      <p>Spain's geographical offerings tend to take a backseat to its world-famous cultural traditions (think bullfights, flamenco, and siestas), but they really shouldn't. Spain is filled with stunning shorelines and islands that resemble those in the Caribbean.</p>

                      <p>In Angra dos Reis, there's the always-gorgeous Ilha Grande (“big island”). More than 113 beaches spread over only 30 kilometers. The most famous one? Without a doubt Lopes Mendes, the true prototype of a paradise shelter.</p>
